Can I move the robot simply with goto position

I can move the motors in position the problem was too high a gain in B&R. 
The next step si to move in Cartesian State.


Note the robots parameters and the intial platform position are stored in robot_parameters.yaml . After which we use integration to find the new joint limits.

The idea is to recieve a Cartesian position do a simple open loop controller, the intergration of the position is completed simply using 
the jacobian matrix of the robot. It should be ok.
